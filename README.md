# full-stack-java

In this project, I tried to discover the whole cycle of creating Java enterprise Spring boot application.

Here's what is done:

- API development (Models, Services, Controllers, DAOs, Repositories..)

- Databases & PostgreSQL (I am going to discover both (Spring Data JPA and JDBC for efficient database communication)

- Testing
- Docker for containerization and deployment
- Spring Security 6 for secure, authenticated applications (Login/Registration systems for user management)

- Angular for powerful, responsive front-end interfaces (with TypeScript language for type-safe, scalable code)

- AWS for cloud-based hosting and scaling

- DevOps best practices for agile, collaborative development
